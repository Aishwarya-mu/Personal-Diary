# Personal-Diary
A Simple app which acts like your personal diary using pure JavaScript and bootstrap.

Personal Diary websites are the online equivalent of your personal diaries, and because they are digital, they can do more for you than paper ever could. You can even build a more advanced level Personal Diary website, but we will keep it simple for now, as it is our first project!

Setting Up the Project
For this project, we will use the VS Code. Visual Studio Code is a free and powerful source-code editor that runs on the desktop. 
The project setup is really simple. Because we only want to use JavaScript without any frameworks. Start by creating a new project folder in VS Code, and inside that project folder, create two empty new files: index.html and app.js. The index.html file is the entry point for our website and contains the HTML code. In this project, we are also using Bootstrap. If you are not familiar with Bootstrap, then do not worry; just follow the tutorial. The file app.js will be included in index.html.
Bootstrap:
If you are studying web development, you must have come across the word Bootstrap. It is used for applying styling the user interface components. The easiest way to include Bootstrap is to add it from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/.
Bootstrap is bundled with many components that can be used to provide good user experience and user interactions in a web page like cards, navigation bars, dropdowns, icons, buttons, forms and also sizing options for different DOM elements. In this project, we are using bootstrap components for making the front end of website. Then after designing the website, we will add logic into it using pure JavaScript.
